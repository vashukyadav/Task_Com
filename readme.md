# Bynry Backend Engineering Intern – Case Study

This repository contains my solution for the Bynry backend case study.
The focus of this submission is on problem understanding, system design,
and logical approach rather than a production-ready implementation.

## Structure
- Part 1: Code review and identified issues
- Part 2: High-level database design
- Part 3: Low-stock alert API logic
- Assumptions made due to incomplete requirements

## Notes
This solution intentionally keeps implementations simple and readable,
as the goal is to demonstrate thought process and learning potential.
